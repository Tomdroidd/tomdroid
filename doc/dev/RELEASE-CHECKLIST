Make sure to do this before every release:

Testing
- Download Translations from Launchpad and convert them to xml (described in util/xml2po/README)
- Run Unit Tests
- Test all functionality and selected translations on emulator 1.6 (base), 2.3 (still common) and 4.4 (latest)
- Test with "Immediately destroy activities" debug setting
- Test all text inputs with virtual keyboard
- Test with public sdcard image all the bug notes to spot regressions
- Test sharing a note and receiving a note to/from any other app
- Test creating and deleting shortcuts on homescreen

Preparing the release
- Remove "dev" from version number in AndroidManifest.xml (android:versionCode and android:versionName), README
- Make sure TODO is up-to-date
- Update the NEWS file
- Make sure README is accurate
- Follow Android's doc on publishing apps to the marketplace
- Generate ChangeLog (bzr log -v -n0 --gnu-changelog > ChangeLog)
- Make sure AUTHORS is accurate (grep '<.*@.*>' ChangeLog | awk '// {print $2,$3,$4}'  | sort | uniq)

Releasing on launchpad
- Disable logging (set org.tomdroid.util.TLog.LOGGING_ENABLED to false)
- Export an unsigned apk
- Sign the apk
-- if I don't remember my alias again!: keytool -keystore <keystore> -list -v
-- jarsigner -verbose -keystore <keystore> <apk> <alias>
-- verify: jarsigner -verify -verbose -certs <apk>
- Align the apk
-- zipalign -f -v 4 <old apk> <new apk>
-- verify: zipalign -c -v 4 <new apk>
- Test the signed apk
- Test the upgrade from the previous signed release to the next one
- bzr tag the release / Commit / push
- Produce the source release tarball (bzr export --format=tgz tomdroid-src-X.X.X.tar.gz) 
- Mark the milestone as released on launchpad
- Put the files on launchpad (SRC, README, APK)
- Announce on launchpad

Releasing on the Google Play Store / Amazon Appstore
- Make sure description and all is still accurate. The strings are in res/values/strings.xml (and check for updated translations too)
- Take screenshots and put them in data/market-screenshots/ and upload them to the market (if relevant)
- Publish

Spread the word
- Email to Tomdroid's mailing list (Tomboy/Snowy too if it's an important milestone)
- post to identi.ca / LinkedIn status / facebook
- ohloh, freshmeat
- Blog post about it including NEWS but also what I see for +1 (link the launchpad's announce to it and post blog link on mailing lists) 

Next
- Create the next milestone on launchpad
- Mark bugs as fix released
-- email interface edit@bugs.launchpad.net is useful for that. <space>bug $bugid\n<space>status fixreleased
- Increment version number and append "dev" to android:versionCode in AndroidManifest.xml
- android:debuggable="true" in AndroidManifest.xml
